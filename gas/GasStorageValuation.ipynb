    "#Gas Storage Valuation with Forward Trading\n",
    "\n",
    "A widely used approach for gas storage valuation is the rolling intrinsic value, which is often used to price storage contracts and to derive trading decisions. However, it is well-known that the result underestimates the true value of storage since the rolling intrinsic value is a conservative figure. We are therefore going to conduct a *stochastic* rolling intrinsic valuation, which has been proposed in the article \"[Optimal gas storage valuation and futures trading under a high-dimensional price process](http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2015/05/4913.pdf)\" by Nils LÃ¶hndorf and David Wozabal (2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "The stochastic rolling intrinsic value can be obtained from computing the discounted cash flow of the optimal operational and trading policies. An optimal policy does not only need to consider the possible evolution of storage over time but also the dynamics of the forward curve as well as possible positions of all forward contracts that are held over time. The resulting stochastic-dynamic optimization problem has a high dimensionality, but by combining the discrete lattice with QUASAR's powerful approximate dynamic programming engine, the valuation problem can be solved in a short amount of time."

    "The *wait-and-see* part ensures that all contractual positions made at the forward market yield an implementable policy under the currently held forward positions and physical state of the storage. A feasible policy that would ignore possible future decisions and states, would be to greedely rebalance the forward positions while meeting its obligations of matured contracts in an optimal way."
